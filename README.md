Simple project for demonstrating my development workflow.

## Application design

### Color schema

Used [google color tool](https://material.io/resources/color) to play around and decide on color
scheme for the app.

Primary color: white. Secondary color: cyan(#00bcd4).

See [here](https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=0&view.right=0&primary.color=ECEFF1&secondary.color=00BCD4)
for full color mapping details.

> Note: I wanted to incorporate green colors in the app because of the psychological associations humans have with that color. See [here](https://www.apptunix.com/blog/mobile-app-color-themes/) to learn more. I ultimately pick cyan because I prefer blue and the psychological associations with it also favors the feelings we want induce in users.
